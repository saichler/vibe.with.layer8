# Pitch

Containers took off in 2013, but enterprises weren’t ready. 
The result: billions lost in inefficiencies that still compound today.

AI “vibing” is gaining traction. New players, like Base44, are emerging to offer 
vibing-as-a-service, and they’re popping up everywhere.

# Problem

70–90% of today’s code is bloated, creating massive maintenance overhead. 
Companies bleed resources trying to keep it alive, often hiring armies of developers 
just to stand still.

AI is powerful, but it can’t design robust, scalable systems on its own. 
Without professional architectural guidance, it produces the same bloated, 
fragile code that created today’s software crisis in the first place.

# Solution

Layer 8 fixes this. We’ve built a platform that transforms AI-generated prototypes 
into production-grade, scalable, and secure applications, without the armies of developers 
or endless patchwork. It’s the missing layer that turns today’s AI hype into tomorrow’s 
enterprise reality.


# Why Now

AI is accelerating software creation at unprecedented speed—but it also risks amplifying the same 
inefficiencies. Without a new foundation, the bloat only grows faster. 
Enterprises urgently need a way to harness AI for production-grade, lean, and sustainable 
software.

# Competition & Diffranciation
Competitors such as Base44 provide vibing solutions for enterprises, but their approach
is limited to a pure as-a-service model. This creates strong vendor lock-in,
with enterprises dependent on the provider for every aspect of their stack.

Layer 8 differentiates by offering flexibility:
* The same SaaS model for those who want it.
* As a Product, enabling enterprises to deploy and control their own environment.
* As a Product for Developers, empowering internal teams with the frameworks and tools to innovate without lock-in.
